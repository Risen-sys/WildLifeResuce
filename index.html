        <p>Welcome to Wild Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and release wildlife back into their natural environment. 
            We are a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife.
        </p>

        <p>Our staff provides around the clock care for wildlife in need. 
            We also provide long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released back into their natural environment.
        </p>

        <p>Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help care for our animals. You can also donate, become a member, or become a sponsor.
